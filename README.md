# Introduction

Hi! My name is Aneta. I moved to San Diego almost 2 years ago from an awesome city in Poland - Cracow. Here's a picture of this very old, beautiful city's Market Square which is the biggest in Europe:

 ## More about me
 
 I like to travel and an idea of staying in one place for too long makes me feel trapped. I also don't like working for other people, because that means that someone else is creating my schedule. That is why I enrolled for this class - to be my own boss. Some facts about me:
 
 1. The coolest (literally) place I've ever been to: Kiruna, Lapland (yup, I tried reindeer soup there and saw an ice hotel)
 2. I hitchhiked through Europe, twice
 3. When I moved to San Diego I had nothing set up, so first two weeks I had to couchsurf.
 4. I was horse riding for around 10 years (I do not do it anymore) and I had my own horse
 5. I was studying in Sweden for 5 months
 6. I'm 28 and my close friends are my high school friends - 2 of them I know since kindergarden (I was 6 years old) and we've been friends ever since
 7. I seriously considered being a pet masseuse (yes it's a real job, massage fluffy dogs and getting paid quite good money for it, dream job)
